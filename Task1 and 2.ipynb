Every time that a star-forming event occurs, the newborn, massive stars produce large amounts of UV radiation: radiation that’s energetic enough to ionize hydrogen atoms. All of a sudden, space that was once filled with neutral hydrogen atoms is now filled with free protons and free electrons.\n","But those electrons are going to eventually be captured, once again, by those protons, and when there’s no longer enough ultraviolet radiation to ionize them over and over again, the electrons will once again sink down to the ground state, where they’ll have a 50/50 chance of being aligned or anti-aligned with the spin of the atomic nucleus.\n","Again, that same radiation — of 21 centimeters in wavelength — gets produced, and every time we measure that 21 centimeter wavelength localized in a specific region of space, even if it gets redshifted by the expansion of the Universe, what we’re seeing is evidence of recent star-formation. Wherever star-formation occurs, hydrogen gets ionized, and whenever those atoms become neutral and de-excite again, this specific-wavelength radiation persists for tens of millions of years.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"dd1dde35","metadata":{"id":"dd1dde35"},"source":["**TASK 1**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0243bcda","metadata":{"id":"0243bcda"},"source":["# Gaussian Fit for Spectral Lines\n","\n","Use synthetic spectra available for different spectrums of different distance intervals within that is a Hydrogen 21 cm line at a Doppler velocity.Fit for the Doppler velocity of the 21 cm line for each distance.

In most galaxies, including spiral galaxies like our Milky Way, the rotation curve shows unexpected behavior. According to Newtonian mechanics, the rotation speed should decrease with increasing distance from the center due to the decrease in gravitational attraction from the enclosed mass. However, observations reveal that the rotation speed remains roughly constant at large distances from the galactic center, defying expectations and forming a flat plateau. This discrepancy suggests the presence of significant amounts of unseen dark matter, exerting additional gravitational forces and stabilizing the rotation curve. The galaxy rotation curve has been a crucial piece of evidence supporting the existence of dark matter, an elusive and invisible form of matter that constitutes a substantial portion of the universe's mass and plays a fundamental role in shaping the large-scale structure of the cosmos.\n","\n","\n","Plot the galaxy rotation curve using the data.\n","\n","(HINT: Find velocities using the famous Doppler shift formula)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"e8216a18","metadata":{"id":"e8216a18"},"outputs":[],"source":["#Your code here"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5760305e","metadata":{"id":"5760305e"},"source":["**TASK 2**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0b7e8035","metadata":{"id":"0b7e8035"},"source":["# MARKOV CHAIN MONTE CARLO (MCMC)\n","\n","First, go through this very elaborative tutorial (https://prappleizer.github.io/Tutorials/MCMC/MCMC_Tutorial.html) to understand what MCMC really is.
